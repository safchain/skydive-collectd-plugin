# Skydive Collectd plugin

This packages implements a Collectd plugin that will send Collectd metrics to Skydive Agent.
Currently the metrics will reported on the `Host` node under the sub key `Collectd`.

# Installation

In order to compile the `Skydive Collectd plugin` one need to have the [Collectd sources](https://github.com/collectd/collectd).

```
export COLLECTD_SRC=/tmp/collectd

git clone https://github.com/collectd/collectd $COLLECTD_SRC

mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/skydive-project
git clone https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive-collectd-plugin.git \
  $GOPATH/src/github.com/skydive-project/skydive-collectd-plugin
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skydive-project/skydive-collectd-plugin

make
```

This will generate a shared object (`skydive.so`) that can be placed in the collectd plugin folder.

# Configuration

```
LoadPlugin skydive
<Plugin skydive>
    Address "127.0.0.1:8081"
    Username ""
    Password ""
</Plugin>
```

The address has to be the Skydive Agent `listen` address.
